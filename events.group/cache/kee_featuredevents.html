If you're interested in membership at Northland, we hope you'll join us at the next Belong seminar. Find out why so many of us are excited to be part of the Northland family and how you can be part of it too!

Attending the seminar that morning doesn’t commit you to joining Northland. It's just an opportunity to hear from Pastor Joel and other church leaders about the role Northland has in bringing “up there down here.” So if you or someone you know is curious about Northland and wondering what it means to belong, then we hope you'll join us!</p></div></article><article class="card card-event"><p class="date tablet-show">Sep<span>11</span></p><div class="featured-image" style="background-image: url(http://images-cf.localist.com/photos/298589/huge/0f45854f6334dbb51e7e26b348a39850463ef12c.jpg);"><img src="http://images-cf.localist.com/photos/298589/huge/0f45854f6334dbb51e7e26b348a39850463ef12c.jpg" class="visually-hidden"><a href="http://calendar.northlandchurch.net/event/baptism_7824"></a></div><div class="copy-container"><div class="details"><div class="detail-left tablet-hide"><p class="date">Sep<span>11</span></p></div><div class="detail-right"><h3 class="title"><a href="">Baptism</a></h3></div></div><p class="body-copy">Baptism is an outward expression of our inward faith, a declaration to the world that we've chosen to follow Jesus Christ ... a washing away of the old life, committing ourselves completely as followers of Jesus Christ. It's an instruction given to us by Jesus in Matthew 28, and even Jesus Himself was baptized. 

If you have never been baptized before this is your chance to take this step of obedience in Christ! If you have recommitted yourself to following Christ and desire to make a public statement of that through baptism, you are also welcome. Be sure to invite your friends and family to celebrate with you!
