		<h2>People Who Sing Jesus</h2> begins with a mysterious, cosmic, biblical principle: <span>The date on your birth certificate is only partially correct.</span><br>
		Your arrival on this planet may have taken place at a precise day and time, but the formation of your life occurred long ago in a pre-Genesis moment. Though time exists for creation, God exists outside of those dimensions established beyond time and space.
		<br><br>
		Northland's minister for service and equipping, <a href="/staff/sean_cooper/">Sean Cooper</a>, explores the mystery of God’s design for humanity and in turn explains why Christians so passionately follow their Creator, Jesus. For those who sing Jesus, God’s thoughtful attention to their existence says much about them but even more so, speaks much about their Creator.
