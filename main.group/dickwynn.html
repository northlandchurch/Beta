Dick served in the ministry of Youth for Christ for 34 years in several leadership roles, including President of the national organization and Asia Pacific Area Director. He was an ordained pastor in the Wesleyan Church and while with YFC, also served as a founding pastor of Kentwood Community Church. He faithfully served the ministries of Emerging Young Leaders, Equip, Crown Financial Ministries and Care for Pastors.</p>
				
				<p>Dick is survived by his wife, Janet, daughter Ronda (Dan) Chapin, son Jeff (Bonnie), and four grandchildren, Zack and Amanda Chapin, Alex and Maggie Wynn. His funeral service was held this week in Grand Rapids, Mich.</p>
