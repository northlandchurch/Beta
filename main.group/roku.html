            <p>Looking for a way to stream Northland's worship services to your TV, 
          		without complicated PC-to-TV hookups? Starting at $59, and about the size 
          		of a paperback novel, the Roku set-top box is one of the most compact and 
          		least expensive ways to bring the church into just about any room. Roku's 
          		Northland channel offers easy access to live worship services, along with 
          		past sermons, music and classes. Ideally suited for house churches, it's a
          		 great way to gather together for worship as the Bible challenges us to do
          	  in Hebrews 10:25: “And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some 
          		people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his
          		 return is drawing near” (NLT). <a href="http://www.northlandchurch.net/blogs/thinking_outside_the_box_northland_launches_first_live_church_on_roku/" target="_blank">Learn more!</a></p>
