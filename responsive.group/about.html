			<h3>Northland History</h3>
			<p>
				In the early 1960's a non-traditional church was flourishing in Chicago, Illinois. 
				The congregation met in a rented warehouse and experienced vibrant, contemporary worship. 
				It was called Circle Church and its pastor was David Mains. Throughout the nation, other congregations 
				patterned after Circle Church began to spring up; one was Clearwater Community Church in Florida. 
				When Lyle and Marge Nelson, members of Clearwater Community Church, were transferred to Orlando in 
				the late 1960s, they searched in vain to find a church similar to the one they had just left. <br />
